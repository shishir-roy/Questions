Regarding the 3rd point of regex configuration enhancement, easy selection of characters in regex. To the best of my knowledge, I haven't found 
anything like the current android mobile UI for wpf or telerik. Some of the closely related solutions that I've found are like the following screenshot 
using one of RadRichTextEditor/ RadPdfViewer/ SelectionMiniToolBar/ RadTextBoxControl. 
All of the above solutions give lookalike support similar to what we do in Microsoft Word/ Text Editor for selection.
